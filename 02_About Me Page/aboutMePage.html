                It happened so that I had a lot of spare time in last two years. I moved to another country and I had to learn English to communicate with other people. Before my relocation I used to work as a tester, I liked my job and team I worked with, but I always wanted to create something by myself. Also I like to see the result of my work and that is why I decided to become Front End developer.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm looking for Front End internship now and I hope Thinkful will help me to reach my goal. I also hope to find here support and inspiration, good and intersting people. I'm very excited to be a part of studing process, it means a lot for me!

            <p>
                I used to live in Russia, Saint-Petersburg, but two years ago I moved to Netherlands, Amsterdam with my husband and here I am now!

                I think that I'm very lucky, I have the opportunity to live in such beautiful and authentic cities. This two places are different in a lot of ways, but both of them gave me so much and I'm sure will inspire me in my future work.
